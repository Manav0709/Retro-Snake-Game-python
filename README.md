# 🐍 Modular Snake Game Using OOP in Python

A classic Snake game built using Python's `turtle` module, showcasing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## 📌 Features

- Real-time snake movement
- Food generation and consumption logic
- Scoreboard with live updates
- Game over and restart functionality
- Modular design with clean class-based structure

## 🧠 OOP Concepts Demonstrated

- **Encapsulation**: Separate classes for each game entity (Snake, Food, Scoreboard)
- **Abstraction**: Clean interface for each class hiding internal logic
- **Inheritance**: Extended functionality using Turtle graphics
- **Polymorphism**: Reusable methods and behavior customizations

## 📁 Project Structure

- `main.py` – Game entry point, sets up the screen and controls the main loop
- `snake.py` – Snake class definition and movement logic
- `food.py` – Food class responsible for placing and refreshing food items
- `scoreboard.py` – Displays score and handles game-over logic
